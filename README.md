'Lumpy Chat' is an instant messaging application. The application is created by using firebase, react
and socket.io. To be able to run the source code some libraries have to be installed for two different
directories. The libraries that need to be installed for each directory is given below:

server -> npm i 
	  npm i socket.io
	  npm i cors
	  npm i express


client -> npm socket.io-client
	  npm i lodash
	  npm i ant
	  npm i firebase
	  
After installing the libraries, the react project is run under the client directory with command:
npm start
To communicate between two servers, the local host page should be also open at another browser.
